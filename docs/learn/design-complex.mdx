title: "Design a Complex Task Judgment"
description: "Acontext allows you to add rules to judge what is a complex task."

Acontext won't just learn every success/failed tasks into the skill space. It only learns the complex tasks.

## What is a Complex Task?

By default, the task complexity is judged based on these conditions:
- **(c.1)** Wrong tool parameter passing that could be avoided: **normal**
- **(c.2)** Back-and-forth retries due to wrong strategy (not errors): **normal**
- **(c.3)** User provides feedback/preferences to correct agent's wrong decision: **critical**
- **(c.4)** User explicitly emphasized saving this workflow or experience: **critical**

<Info>
If one `critical` rule is satisfied, the task will be considered as a complex task.
</Info>
<Info>
If at least two `normal` rules are satisfied, the task will be considered as a complex task.
</Info>

## Design your own Complexity Scoring Rules
You can append more rules to enrich the complexity judgment, by passing `config.yaml`:
```yaml config.yaml
sop_agent_custom_scoring_rules:
  - description: "User wants another theme of landing page"
    level: "normal"
  - description: "When the word 'save this as sop' appears in the user's message, it's a complex task"
    level: "critical"
```
